I have been successfully trading financial markets for circa twenty years. Even as far back as 1999 I was featured in FOW Magazine (see images)

Of course being featured in a magazine is not that important, but what was reported about me certainly was. You see, even as far back as 1999 I had discovered a way to predict market moves ‘better than eight time out of ten’ Yes that is what the researcher reported and wrote in the magazine and believe me things have moved on a lot from those early years. (I have  lot less hair now)

A few years later I bought a house in Spain and went to retire in the sunshine. Reality was of course that at age less that 40years that was never going to be a lasting decision.

I was about this time I was mentioned in a Sunday times Article and as a result of this I was contacted by traders to see if I would consider training them to do what I had done.

I set up a live trading room in Spain with a satellite data feed streaming in and away we went. Traders came from all over the world to watch me trade. My averages were pretty good as well. Out of ten courses I would make money on seven, break even on two and lose on one.

It was strange but it always seemed like the attendees learned more on the break even and losing courses than they did on the great successes.

My experience grew as as a trader trainer and I could see first hand what was working and what was not. The traders I struggled with were what I call 100% paternized traders. This trader could not get their mind past the  price bar they saw on the the screen. To them this was the only reality of the market.

Gradually I discovered a way to lead a trader past this sticking point and to get them to understand that every price move was dependent upon someone developing a belief about future price. Without this belief a trader would not be able to place a trade. This was a watershed moment for many traders as they realised that it was BELIEF that was at the back of every trading decision.

					This book contains often overlooked or just plain ignored facts about trading. Traders who have read this book with twenty plus years under their belt and still come away with some revelations that has had a dramatic effect on their trading.

Equally if you are new to trading then you will have one of the most solid foundations upon which to base your future trading upon.

Its a trading book that you read and instantly see the logic and then adapt this logic into your trading. You continue for a few weeks or months with this new insight to great success. Then suddenly you notice that you have drifted into that annoying losing streak again. You pick up the book again and BOOM! there it is. You are back on track. This books is one to keep on your desk and in eye sight. I quick refresh read will keep your trading in tip top condition moving for ward. (actually the smart phone is a great place to keep this book)

You can grab a copy on Amazon for the Kindle. If you don’t have a kindle then you can read it on your computer – smart phone with the free reader.

The book is less than the price of a good coffee and unlike a coffee if you are not 100% over the moon with the value of what you receive you can just get an instant refund. Not a bad deal right!

Just one more thing… I promise its’ not one of those ‘really’ annoying books that just tries to sell you other stuff. In fact there is only one url link in the book right at the end that links back to this site (hey I don’t want you to get lost)
